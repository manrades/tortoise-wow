.SYNOPSIS
    Automated testlab pipeline for Tortoise-WoW and Playerbots compilation and deployment.
.DESCRIPTION
    This script automates the full deployment workflow, including client data verification,
    vcpkg dependency check, Git synchronization with submodules, CMake/MSBuild compilation,
    directory restructuring, configuration tuning, and automated database generation.

    Every parameter is optional and every default is the one this testlab uses, so a plain
    run needs no arguments at all. PowerShell renders the SYNTAX block above as one long
    line whatever the source looks like; the same parameters, grouped by what they do:

      Run mode
        -SkipBotRegen             keep accounts, characters and playerbot data
        -applyPatches             "hash1;hash2" to cherry-pick before building

      Where things live
        -WorkspaceRoot            testlab root            (default: this script's folder)
        -VcpkgDirectory           vcpkg                   (default: discovered)
        -VcpkgTriplet             vcpkg triplet           (default: x64-windows)

      What to build
        -RepoUrl                  repository              (default: Shyalya/tortoise-wow)
        -BranchName               branch                  (default: playerbots-integration-gh)
        -PatchRemoteUrl           remote for -applyPatches

      Which database server
        -DbFlavor                 Auto | MariaDB | MySQL  (default: Auto)
        -MariaDbFolderName        portable server folder inside server\
        -MariaDbClientPath        explicit mariadb.exe / mysql.exe
        -DbHost  -DbPort          connection target       (default: the client's own)
        -DbStartupTimeoutSeconds  wait for it to start    (default: 30)

      Database identity
        -RootPassword             root password           (default: mangos)
        -DbUser  -DbPassword      the server's account    (default: mangos / mangos)
        -DbAccountHost            where that account may
                                  connect from            (default: from -DbHost)
        -DbPrefix                 names all four          (default: tw_)
        -WorldDatabaseName  -CharacterDatabaseName
        -LoginDatabaseName  -LogsDatabaseName
                                  override one name       (default: from the prefix)

      Realm and bots
        -RealmlistIPAddress  -RealmlistPort               (default: 127.0.0.1 / 8090)
        -MinRandomBots  -MaxRandomBots                    (default: 5 / 10)
        -RandomBotMinLevel  -RandomBotMaxLevel            (default: 1 / 20)
        -RandomBotAccountsCount                           (default: 10)

      Server logging
        -EnableSqlLog             every SQL query to file (default: off)
        -LogLevel                 0 Minimum | 1 Basic&Error
                                  | 2 Detail | 3 Full/Debug (default: 0)

      Database-only mode
        -DatabaseOnly             skip git/build/folders/config, touch only
                                  the databases (default: off)

    Use "Get-Help .\Setup-Testlab.ps1 -Parameter <name>" for the detail on any one of them,
    or -Examples for the common combinations.
.PARAMETER SkipBotRegen
    Preserves existing accounts, GM characters and playerbot data. 'tw_char' and 'tw_logon'
    are dumped before the run and restored at the end; the dump is verified before anything
    destructive happens, so a failed backup stops the pipeline with the data still intact.
    Without it every database is dropped and rebuilt from scratch.
.PARAMETER DatabaseOnly
    Touches only the databases: no git update, no compilation, no folder cleanup, no
    config file changes. Everything that already exists - the server binaries, etc\,
    the launcher .bat files - is left exactly as it is. Use it to re-test a change to
    sql/base or a new migration against a genuine first boot, without waiting for a
    full rebuild. Combine with -SkipBotRegen to reset only 'tw_world' (tw_char and
    tw_logon are backed up and restored, untouched in effect) - the "tw_world
    First-Boot Reset" case; without -SkipBotRegen all four databases are dropped and
    rebuilt, same as a full run's database step. Start the server yourself afterwards
    (the existing launcher .bat files) - that boot is the actual test: an empty
    'migrations' table means the DB Auto-Updater applies every migration exactly as
    it would on a brand-new install.
.PARAMETER applyPatches
    Semicolon-separated git commit hashes to cherry-pick onto the branch before building,
    fetched from -PatchRemoteUrl. Example: "0ee0748;abc1234". Uncommitted local changes are
    stashed first, never discarded.
.PARAMETER WorkspaceRoot
    The testlab root: the folder holding 'server\' and the 'tortoise-wow\' checkout.
    Defaults to the folder this script sits in. Relative paths are resolved against your
    current directory. Everything else the pipeline touches is derived from this one path.
.PARAMETER VcpkgDirectory
    vcpkg installation providing ACE and Boost. Left empty it is discovered: VCPKG_ROOT,
    then vcpkg.exe on PATH, then conventional locations. Given explicitly it is used or the
    run fails - never silently replaced by a discovered one.
.PARAMETER VcpkgTriplet
    vcpkg triplet the dependencies are installed for. Defaults to x64-windows; the build
    itself is always -A x64.
.PARAMETER RootPassword
    Password for the database 'root' account, used for schema creation and imports.
.PARAMETER DbPassword
    Password for the 'mangos' service account this script creates and the server logs in
    with. Written to the database, not to any configuration file.
.PARAMETER DbUser
    Account the server logs in with. Created and granted in step 06, and written into the
    connection strings in mangosd.conf and realmd.conf.
.PARAMETER DbAccountHost
    Host part of the service account step 06 creates - the 'localhost' in
    'mangos'@'localhost'. Empty (default) derives it from -DbHost: 'localhost' for a local
    server, '%' for a remote one, because a remote server sees this machine arriving from
    its own address and never as localhost. Set it explicitly to narrow that down, e.g.
    -DbAccountHost "192.168.1.%".
.PARAMETER DbPrefix
    Prefix for the four database names, default "tw_". Change it to run several testlabs
    against one database server without them overwriting each other - -DbPrefix "lab2_"
    gives lab2_world, lab2_char, lab2_logon and lab2_logs. The schema is renamed on import
    and the server's connection strings are written to match.
.PARAMETER WorldDatabaseName
    Overrides the world database name. Empty (default) means "<prefix>world".
.PARAMETER CharacterDatabaseName
    Overrides the characters database name. Empty (default) means "<prefix>char".
.PARAMETER LoginDatabaseName
    Overrides the login/realm database name. Empty (default) means "<prefix>logon".
.PARAMETER LogsDatabaseName
    Overrides the logs database name. Empty (default) means "<prefix>logs".
.PARAMETER DbFlavor
    Which engine to look for: Auto (default), MariaDB or MySQL. Only narrows discovery -
    useful on a machine that has both installed.
.PARAMETER MariaDbFolderName
    Name of the portable MariaDB directory inside 'server\', tried before PATH and the
    conventional install locations.
.PARAMETER MariaDbClientPath
    Explicit path to mariadb.exe or mysql.exe. Given, it is used or the run fails, because
    connecting to a different server than intended means dropping databases on the wrong
    instance.
.PARAMETER DbHost
    Host to connect to. Empty (default) means the client's own default, which is what the
    bundled portable server wants.
.PARAMETER DbPort
    Port to connect to. 0 (default) means the client's own default.
.PARAMETER DbStartupTimeoutSeconds
    How long the preflight waits for the server to start answering, in seconds. Default 30.
    'server\1.Start mysql.bat' launches mysqld asynchronously, so a run started right after
    it needs a moment. A wrong password is never retried.
.PARAMETER RepoUrl
    Source repository to clone or pull.
.PARAMETER BranchName
    Branch to build. Point it at a topic branch to test one without editing anything.
.PARAMETER PatchRemoteUrl
    Remote the -applyPatches commits are fetched from.
.PARAMETER RealmlistIPAddress
    Address written into tw_logon.realmlist, and the one your client's realmlist.wtf has to
    point at.
.PARAMETER RealmlistPort
    Port written into tw_logon.realmlist. Must match WorldServerPort in mangosd.conf, which
    ships as 8090; a mismatch lets login succeed and then hangs the client before character
    selection.
.PARAMETER MinRandomBots
    Lower bound of the playerbot population written into aiplayerbot.conf.
.PARAMETER MaxRandomBots
    Upper bound of the playerbot population. The shipped template asks for a thousand, which
    turns the first start into a long wait for no benefit.
.PARAMETER RandomBotMinLevel
    Lowest level random bots are generated at.
.PARAMETER RandomBotMaxLevel
    Highest level random bots are generated at.
.PARAMETER RandomBotAccountsCount
    Number of bot accounts to create.
.PARAMETER EnableSqlLog
    Writes every SQL statement mangosd sends to a log file (LogSQL in mangosd.conf). Off by
    default: at LogSQL = 1 it is 94% of a normal run's console log, most of it the
    per-connection 'SET NAMES' / 'SET CHARACTER SET' every pooled database connection issues
    on open - not an error, just noise that buries the handful of lines that matter. Turn it
    on when you are chasing a specific query, e.g. a deadlock.
.PARAMETER LogLevel
    Console/log verbosity for mangosd and realmd: 0 Minimum, 1 Basic & Error, 2 Detail,
    3 Full/Debug. Defaults to 0; the shipped templates default to 1. This does not affect
    the DB content warnings step 01 and mangosd's table loader print on startup (missing
    creature_movement paths and the like) - those come from the world database's own
    content, not from this setting, and stay visible at every level.
.EXAMPLE
    .\Run-Testlab.bat
    The normal run: builds everything and rebuilds every database from scratch. Use the .bat
    rather than the .ps1 so no execution-policy change is needed.
.EXAMPLE
    .\Run-Testlab.bat -SkipBotRegen
    Rebuilds the server but keeps your accounts, GM characters and playerbot data.
.EXAMPLE
    .\Run-Testlab.bat -RepoUrl https://github.com/me/tortoise-wow.git -BranchName my-fix
    Builds a fork or topic branch without editing the script.
.EXAMPLE
    .\Run-Testlab.bat -WorkspaceRoot C:\WOW\testlab -VcpkgDirectory D:\vcpkg
    Runs the script straight out of the repository against a testlab folder elsewhere.
.EXAMPLE
    .\Run-Testlab.bat -DbFlavor MySQL -DbPort 3307 -RootPassword "hunter2"
    Uses an installed MySQL on a non-default port instead of the bundled portable MariaDB.
.EXAMPLE
    .\Run-Testlab.bat -applyPatches "0ee0748;abc1234" -SkipBotRegen
    Cherry-picks two hotfixes onto the branch, then rebuilds while preserving character data.
.EXAMPLE
    .\Run-Testlab.bat -WorkspaceRoot C:\WOW\lab2 -DbPrefix "lab2_" -RealmlistPort 8091
    A second, independent testlab on the same machine and the same database server.
.NOTES
    Windows only (PowerShell 5.1+, Visual Studio 2022, CMake). See README.md next to this
    script for the folder layout it expects and what you have to supply yourself.

    Everything printed is also written to 'pipeline_console.log' in the workspace root, and
    the compiler output additionally to 'server_build.log'. No shell redirection needed.

    A wrap-point gotcha in this comment block, for whoever next reformats a paragraph here:
    Get-Help's comment-based-help parser treats any line that starts with a bare period
    (after leading whitespace) as a new section keyword, whether or not it recognises the
    word after the dot. Wrapping -DatabaseOnly's description once put ".bat files ..." at
    the start of a line, and every parameter after it in Get-Help silently vanished - the
    script still ran fine, only its own documentation broke. Keep a non-period word first
    on every wrapped line.
