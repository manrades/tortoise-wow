# Testlab pipeline (Windows)

One PowerShell script that takes a Windows machine from "nothing set up" to a running
Turtle-WoW testlab with playerbots: it verifies the client data, installs the vcpkg
dependencies, clones/updates the source, builds it, lays out the server directory, creates
and fills all four databases, writes the configuration files and generates the launchers.

It is the automated form of [`INSTALL-WINDOWS.md`](../../INSTALL-WINDOWS.md). Read that
document if you want to know *why* any particular step is there — this one only tells you
how to run it.

**Windows only.** PowerShell 5.1 or newer, and it drives MSVC. On Linux, follow
[`INSTALL-LINUX.md`](../../INSTALL-LINUX.md) instead.

---

## What you have to supply

The script automates everything it can, but four things cannot be downloaded for you:

| What | Where it goes | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Client data** | `<testlab>\server\data\` | `dbc`, `maps`, `vmaps`, `mmaps`, extracted from a **Turtle WoW 1.18.1 client, build 7272**. See `INSTALL-WINDOWS.md` §4. |
| **A database** | `<testlab>\server\mariadb-10.3.39-winx64\` | A portable MariaDB is the intended setup — pass `-MariaDbFolderName` if your folder is named differently. It must already be initialised and startable. An installed MariaDB/MySQL works too: with no portable copy present the client is found on `PATH` or in the usual install locations. |
| **Visual Studio 2022** | — | Workload *Desktop development with C++*. |
| **CMake ≥ 3.16 and Git** | on `PATH` | — |

vcpkg itself is not installed for you either, but the packages inside it are: point
`-VcpkgDirectory` at your vcpkg checkout and the script installs ACE and the ten Boost
libraries the playerbots module needs.

## What has to be present

### Files this tool is made of

| File | Required? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `Setup-Testlab.ps1` | **yes** | The pipeline itself. |
| `dbc_verifier.json` | **yes** | SHA256 manifest step 01 checks the DBC files against. The run stops without it. Not the same file as `tools/dbc_verification/manifest.json`. |
| `Run-Testlab.bat` | recommended | Launcher that avoids the execution-policy change. The `.ps1` runs fine on its own if your policy already allows it. |
| `README.md` | no | This document. |

Copy the first three together; the script looks for `dbc_verifier.json` in the workspace
root first and falls back to its own folder, so either arrangement works.

### What you supply

| Path | Required? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `server\data\dbc`, `maps`, `vmaps`, `mmaps` | **yes** | Extracted from a **Turtle WoW 1.18.1 client, build 7272**. Every DBC is hash-checked. See `INSTALL-WINDOWS.md` §4. |
| `server\<portable MariaDB>\` | see notes | The intended setup, and the safest: it is a database nothing else uses. Not needed if you point the script at an installed MariaDB/MySQL instead. |

### Tools on the machine

| Tool | Required? | Checked by the preflight |
|---|---|---|
| PowerShell 5.1+ | **yes** | — (it is what runs the script) |
| Git | **yes** | yes, on `PATH` |
| CMake 3.16+ | **yes** | yes, on `PATH` |
| Visual Studio 2022, *Desktop development with C++* | **yes** | best effort, via `vswhere` |
| vcpkg | **yes** | yes — the ACE and Boost packages inside it are installed for you |
| MariaDB or MySQL, running | **yes** | yes, including that it answers and accepts the credentials |

Everything above is verified **before** the pipeline drops a single database.

### What the pipeline creates

`tortoise-wow\` (the clone), `server\bin`, `lib`, `etc`, `tools`, `logs`, `honor`, `pdump`,
`lua_scripts`, the three launcher `.bat` files, and the logs. None of it needs to exist
beforehand.

## Folder layout

The script works inside a *testlab root* that holds the source checkout and the server
side by side:

```
<testlab root>\
├─ Setup-Testlab.ps1          <- this script (when you copy it out)
├─ dbc_verifier.json          <- DBC hash manifest (ships next to the script)
├─ tortoise-wow\              <- created by the script (git clone)
├─ server\
│  ├─ data\                   <- YOU provide: dbc, maps, vmaps, mmaps
│  ├─ mariadb-10.3.39-winx64\ <- YOU provide: portable MariaDB
│  ├─ bin\  etc\  lib\  ...   <- created by the script
│  └─ 1.Start mysql.bat …     <- created by the script
├─ pipeline_console.log       <- full transcript of every run
├─ server_build.log           <- compiler output of the last build
└─ pipeline_running.lock      <- present only while a run is in progress
```

## Logging

Everything the pipeline prints — its own messages **and** the output of git, cmake, vcpkg
and the database client — is written to `pipeline_console.log` in the workspace root as
well as to the console. No `> log.txt` redirection needed.

`server_build.log` additionally holds just the compiler output of the last build, which is
the file to open when a build fails.

> This took explicit work: `Start-Transcript` alone records only what passes through
> PowerShell's own streams. A native command left to write straight to the console, and
> anything started with `Start-Process`, bypass it entirely — so the log used to contain
> the pipeline's own messages and almost nothing from the tools it drives. Native calls are
> now routed back through the pipeline, and the two places that genuinely need
> `Start-Process` capture their output to files and replay it.

## Running it

Two ways, both fine:

**Copy it out** (simplest — the testlab root is wherever the script sits):

```powershell
mkdir C:\WOW\testlab
copy tools\testlab_pipeline\Setup-Testlab.ps1  C:\WOW\testlab\
copy tools\testlab_pipeline\Run-Testlab.bat    C:\WOW\testlab\
copy tools\testlab_pipeline\dbc_verifier.json  C:\WOW\testlab\
cd C:\WOW\testlab
# put server\data\ and server\mariadb-…\ in place first, then:
.\Run-Testlab.bat
```

**Run it in place** from a checkout, pointing at a testlab elsewhere:

```powershell
.\tools\testlab_pipeline\Run-Testlab.bat -WorkspaceRoot C:\WOW\testlab
```

Start MariaDB (`server\1.Start mysql.bat`) before running — the pipeline needs it up, and
the preflight will stop you if it is not.

### Use `Run-Testlab.bat`, not the `.ps1` directly

`Run-Testlab.bat` launches PowerShell with `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoProfile` and
forwards every argument. That scope applies to **that one process** — it changes nothing
permanently, needs no administrator rights, and saves you from running
`Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force` by hand each time. It also clears the
mark-of-the-web Windows attaches to a script that arrived from the internet.

All parameters work through it:

```powershell
.\Run-Testlab.bat -SkipBotRegen
.\Run-Testlab.bat -WorkspaceRoot C:\WOW\testlab -VcpkgDirectory D:\vcpkg
.\Run-Testlab.bat -BranchName my-topic-branch
```

On failure it keeps the window open, so a double-clicked run does not vanish before the
error can be read.

### Parameters

Nothing inside the script needs editing to run it against a different machine, fork or
branch — every environment-specific value is a parameter.

| Parameter | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `-WorkspaceRoot` | the script's folder | Testlab root, as laid out above. Relative paths are resolved against your current directory. |
| `-VcpkgDirectory` | *discovered* | vcpkg providing ACE + Boost. Left out it is found via `VCPKG_ROOT`, then `vcpkg.exe` on `PATH`, then conventional locations. Given explicitly it is used or the run fails — never silently replaced. |
| `-VcpkgTriplet` | `x64-windows` | Triplet the dependencies are installed for. |
| `-RootPassword` | `mangos` | Database `root` password, used for schema creation and imports. |
| `-DbPassword` | `mangos` | Password for the service account the script creates. |
| `-DbUser` | `mangos` | Service account the server logs in with. |
| `-DbAccountHost` | *from `-DbHost`* | Host part of that account — the `localhost` in `'mangos'@'localhost'`. `localhost` for a local server, `%` for a remote one. |
| `-DbPrefix` | `tw_` | Prefix for all four database names — see below. |
| `-WorldDatabaseName` etc. | *from prefix* | Override a single database name. Also `-CharacterDatabaseName`, `-LoginDatabaseName`, `-LogsDatabaseName`. |
| `-MariaDbFolderName` | `mariadb-10.3.39-winx64` | Portable MariaDB folder name inside `server\`, tried first. |
| `-DbFlavor` | `Auto` | `Auto`, `MariaDB` or `MySQL`. Narrows discovery on a machine that has both. |
| `-MariaDbClientPath` | *discovered* | Explicit `mariadb.exe` / `mysql.exe`. Left out: the portable server, then `PATH`, then installed MariaDB/MySQL. Given explicitly it is used or the run fails. |
| `-DbHost` / `-DbPort` | *client default* | Connection target. Leave empty for the bundled portable server. |
| `-DbStartupTimeoutSeconds` | `30` | How long the preflight waits for the server to start answering. |
| `-RepoUrl` | Shyalya/tortoise-wow | Source repository to build. |
| `-BranchName` | `playerbots-integration-gh` | Branch to build — point it at a topic branch to test one. |
| `-PatchRemoteUrl` | Penqle/tortoise-wow | Remote the `-applyPatches` commits are fetched from. |
| `-RealmlistIPAddress` / `-RealmlistPort` | `127.0.0.1` / `8090` | Realm entry written to `tw_logon.realmlist`. The port must match `WorldServerPort`. |
| `-MinRandomBots` / `-MaxRandomBots` | `5` / `10` | Bot population written into `aiplayerbot.conf`. |
| `-RandomBotMinLevel` / `-RandomBotMaxLevel` | `1` / `20` | Bot level range. |
| `-RandomBotAccountsCount` | `10` | Number of bot accounts. |
| `-SkipBotRegen` | off | Keeps existing characters/accounts: dumps `tw_char` + `tw_logon` first and restores them at the end. Also leaves `server\pdump` and `server\honor` in place. |
| `-EnableSqlLog` | off | Writes every SQL statement to a log file (`LogSQL` in `mangosd.conf`). Off by default — on, it's 94% of a normal run's log, mostly per-connection `SET NAMES`/`SET CHARACTER SET` noise. |
| `-LogLevel` | `0` | Console/log verbosity for mangosd and realmd: `0` Minimum, `1` Basic & Error, `2` Detail, `3` Full/Debug. The shipped templates default to `1`. |
| `-DatabaseOnly` | off | Touches only the databases — no git update, no compilation, no folder cleanup, no config file changes. Combine with `-SkipBotRegen` to reset only `tw_world` (a "first-boot" test of a new migration); without it, all four databases are dropped and rebuilt. |
| `-applyPatches` | — | Semicolon-separated commit hashes to cherry-pick, e.g. `-applyPatches "0ee0748;abc1234"`. |

```powershell
.\Run-Testlab.bat -VcpkgDirectory D:\vcpkg -RootPassword "hunter2" -SkipBotRegen
.\Run-Testlab.bat -RepoUrl https://github.com/me/tortoise-wow.git -BranchName my-fix
.\Run-Testlab.bat -DbFlavor MySQL -DbPort 3307
.\Run-Testlab.bat -DatabaseOnly -SkipBotRegen
```

Full help, including every parameter and more examples:

```powershell
Get-Help .\Setup-Testlab.ps1              # description with the parameters grouped by purpose
Get-Help .\Setup-Testlab.ps1 -Full        # every parameter in detail
Get-Help .\Setup-Testlab.ps1 -Parameter DbFlavor
Get-Help .\Setup-Testlab.ps1 -Examples
```

PowerShell renders the `SYNTAX` block as one unbroken line and there is no way to format
it; the grouped list in the description is the readable version. Parameters are named-only,
so a stray unnamed argument is rejected rather than bound to whatever sits in that position.

### Several testlabs on one database server

The four databases are named from `-DbPrefix`, so a second testlab needs one flag:

```powershell
.\Run-Testlab.bat -WorkspaceRoot C:\WOW\lab2 -DbPrefix "lab2_" -RealmlistPort 8091
```

That gives `lab2_world`, `lab2_char`, `lab2_logon` and `lab2_logs` alongside the default
`tw_*` set, untouched. Individual names can be overridden with `-WorldDatabaseName` and its
three siblings when one database has to sit outside the scheme.

Renaming reaches everywhere it has to. `create_databases.sql` names the stock databases in
its `CREATE DATABASE` and `USE` statements, so it is rewritten as it is imported; and the
server has to be told, so the pipeline writes all four `*.Info` connection strings into
`mangosd.conf` and the one in `realmd.conf`.

> Writing those connection strings fixes a bug that predates the prefix. The shipped
> templates hard-code `127.0.0.1;3306;mangos;mangos;tw_*` and nothing rewrote them, so
> `-DbPassword`, `-DbUser`, `-DbHost` and `-DbPort` changed what the *pipeline* connected
> with while the *server* was still told the template's values. Anything but the defaults
> produced a server that could not log in to its own databases. All five lines now come
> from the settings actually in use.

Give each testlab its own `-RealmlistPort` and set `WorldServerPort` in its `mangosd.conf`
to match, or the second realm will hand clients a port nobody is listening on.

### MariaDB or MySQL

Either works. MariaDB is what this testlab ships and what the project targets; MySQL 5.7
and 8 are supported too, and `-DbFlavor` picks a side when both are installed.

Two differences the script already handles, so you do not have to:

- **Client naming.** MariaDB renamed its client to `mariadb.exe` in 10.6, and recent builds
  ship no `mysql.exe` at all — while the 10.3 portable build here has only `mysql.exe`.
  Both spellings are accepted, and the dump tool (`mariadb-dump.exe` / `mysqldump.exe`) is
  paired from the same directory.
- **User creation.** MySQL 8 removed `GRANT ... IDENTIFIED BY`, which is a syntax error
  there while MariaDB still accepts it. The script uses `CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS` plus
  plain `GRANT`s, which both engines accept.

Logging into a **remote or shared** server works through `-DbHost` / `-DbPort`, but be
deliberate about it: the pipeline drops `tw_world`, `tw_char`, `tw_logon` and `tw_logs` on
whatever it connects to. The preflight prints the client, how it was found, and the
server's version, host and port for exactly this reason — read that line on an unfamiliar
machine.

On a remote server the service account is created as `'mangos'@'%'`, because the server
sees this machine arriving from its own address and never as `localhost`. Narrow it with
`-DbAccountHost "192.168.1.%"` when the network allows it.

## What a run does

| Step | |
|---|---|
| 00 | Variables, run lock, temporary MariaDB credential files, vcpkg discovery |
| 00b | **Preflight** — git, cmake, vcpkg, mysql (and mysqldump for `-SkipBotRegen`), MariaDB reachable, VS C++ toolset |
| 01 | Client data present + every DBC checked against `dbc_verifier.json` |
| 02 | `vcpkg install` for ACE and Boost |
| 03 | Clone or pull the source, update submodules; optional cherry-picks |
| — | *(`-SkipBotRegen`)* verified `mysqldump` of `tw_char` + `tw_logon` |
| 04 | Stop running servers, wipe generated server dirs, drop databases |
| 05 | `create_databases.sql`, then all 186 world files from `sql\base` |
| 06 | Create the `mangos` database user |
| — | *(`-SkipBotRegen`)* restore the dumps |
| 07 | `character_inventory_copy` honor hotfix table |
| 08 | CMake configure + Release build → `server_build.log` |
| 09 | Install, sort binaries into `bin\`/`tools\`, DLLs into `lib\`, configs into `etc\` |
| 10 | Rewrite paths in `mangosd.conf` |
| 11 | Import the playerbots module SQL |
| 12 | Scale the bot population down in `aiplayerbot.conf` |
| 13 | Insert the local realm into `tw_logon.realmlist` |
| 14 | Create `logs\`, `honor\`, `pdump\`, `lua_scripts\` |
| 15 | Generate the three launcher `.bat` files, refreshing stale ones |

Afterwards: `server\1.Start mysql.bat`, then `2.Realm server.bat`, then
`3.World server.bat`. Create your account from the mangosd console with `account create`.

`-DatabaseOnly` skips steps 01, 02, 03, 08, 09, 10, 12 and 15 outright, and the folder-wipe
half of step 04 (the database-drop half still runs) — everything that isn't a database
operation. Steps 00b, 05, 06, 07, 11, 13, 14 and the `-SkipBotRegen` backup/restore run
exactly as they would in a full build.

### Build flags it passes

Two of these are easy to get wrong by hand and are the reason a manual Windows build
often fails where Linux succeeds:

- `-DUSE_PCH=OFF -DUSE_PCH_OLD=OFF` — the `/FI` force-include fallback only runs when
  `USE_PCH_OLD` is off, and it defaults to **on** for MSVC.
- `-DBUILD_PLAYERBOTS=ON` alongside `-DMODULE_MOD_PLAYERBOTS=static` — the module's
  sources compile either way, but without `BUILD_PLAYERBOTS` it never receives its
  compile definitions or the `botpch.h` force-include.

## Safety behaviour

- **Single instance per machine.** The pipeline drops databases and wipes the server
  directory, so two overlapping runs would corrupt the result. A named mutex
  (`Global\TortoiseWoW-Testlab-Pipeline`, falling back to `Local\` when the account lacks
  the privilege to create a global object) refuses the second run with exit code 2. The
  kernel releases it the moment the owning process ends, so a run killed with Ctrl+C or
  Task Manager cannot lock the testlab out.
  Beside it, `pipeline_running.lock` records PID, start time, user and machine so you can
  see *who* is running; a file left behind by a killed run is recognised as stale and taken
  over automatically.
- **`-SkipBotRegen` verifies its own backup.** Step 05 imports `create_databases.sql`,
  which carries `DROP TABLE` for every table in `tw_char`, so the character data is
  genuinely dropped and restored rather than left alone. The dump is therefore checked for
  a non-trivial size and mysqldump's `-- Dump completed` trailer *before* anything
  destructive runs; if it looks wrong the pipeline stops with your data still intact.
- **No passwords on the command line.** Credentials go into temporary MariaDB option files
  (readable only by the current user, deleted on exit) rather than `-p<password>`
  arguments, which any local user can read out of the process list.
- **Uncommitted source changes are stashed, not discarded**, when `-applyPatches` needs a
  clean tree.
- **The DBC manifest is checked before it is trusted.** `dbc_verifier.json` describes the
  last officially released client and is not meant to change, so the script carries its
  expected fingerprint and refuses to run against a shipped copy that does not match.
  Without that, a truncated download or a manifest belonging to a different client build
  would just make step 01 verify the DBCs against the wrong hashes — passing when it should
  not, or blaming the client instead of the manifest. A **workspace** copy is a deliberate
  override and is only reported, not refused; if the client is ever updated, run the
  pipeline, take the hash it prints and put it in `$script:ExpectedDbcManifestChecksum`.
- **Launchers cannot go stale behind your back.** Each generated `.bat` carries a marker
  line with the version that wrote it and a checksum of its body, so step 15 can tell three
  situations apart: unchanged and current (skipped), written by an older pipeline and never
  edited since (refreshed, so a fix like the MariaDB working-directory one actually reaches
  a testlab that was set up months ago), and hand-edited or hand-made (left alone, with a
  warning). Edit them freely — an edited file is never overwritten.
- **Everything is checked before anything is destroyed.** Step 04 drops the databases and
  wipes the server directory, so every tool and service the run depends on is verified in
  the preflight first. A missing `cmake` used to surface in step 08 — four steps *after*
  the data was gone.
- **It tells you which database server it is about to wipe.** The client is resolved with
  the testlab's own portable server first, so a run cannot quietly drop `tw_world` /
  `tw_char` / `tw_logon` / `tw_logs` on a system-wide instance just because one happened to
  be on `PATH`. The preflight logs the client path, how it was found, and the server's
  version, hostname and port.
- **Waiting, not guessing, on startup.** `1.Start mysql.bat` launches mysqld
  asynchronously, so the preflight retries for `-DbStartupTimeoutSeconds` instead of
  failing on the first refused connection. A wrong password is *not* retried — waiting
  cannot fix it — so bad credentials still fail immediately, with the server's own message.
- **No absolute paths.** The workspace root is the single anchor, resolved to a full path
  up front, and every other location is a relative segment joined onto it. The testlab
  folder can be renamed, moved or sit on another drive with no edits. (The root is
  normalised deliberately: the script mixes PowerShell cmdlets with .NET file APIs, and
  .NET keeps its own current directory that `Push-Location` does not update — a relative
  root would make the two disagree, including for the `Remove-Item -Recurse` in step 04.) Recover them with `git -C tortoise-wow stash pop`.

## Known caveats

- **Database migrations.** The pipeline points `Database.AutoUpdate.Path` at the
  repository's `sql\database_updates` and leaves the rest to the server's auto-updater.
  `INSTALL-WINDOWS.md` §5 explains when that is not enough and how to apply the migrations
  by hand.
- **Full rebuild every run.** Step 08 deletes `build\` before configuring, so every run is
  a cold build of the whole tree. That is deliberate — it is what makes the result
  reproducible — but it costs the usual half hour or more.
